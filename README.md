# TYPO3 Extbase Extension Based on Content Blocks

This extension uses the **["friendsoftypo3/content-blocks"](https://github.com/FriendsOfTYPO3/content-blocks)** extension to dynamically generate its **TCA (Table Configuration Array)** and **SQL** through **Content Blocks (RecordTypes)**. Despite including 4 models, the only manually written TCA in this extension is the registration of a plugin in [`tt_content.php`](./Configuration/TCA/Overrides/tt_content.php). All necessary SQL is automatically generated by Content Blocks.

## Half the Work, Double the Efficiency
Content Blocks provides the **code basis** for generating all the **TCA** and **SQL**. By using Content Blocks, you use an existing, robust, community-driven tool that simplifies TYPO3 development.

- **Out-of-the-Box Functionality**: Content Blocks already includes **CLI commands** to generate new content blocks, saving you time and effort.
- **Future Enhancements**: As Content Blocks evolves, with this approach you directly benefit from new features, such as additional CLI commands or even a **GUI-based interface** for managing content blocks. This ensures your extension remains up-to-date and aligned with the latest TYPO3 advancements.

This collaborative approach not only reduces redundancy but also ensures that your extension stays modern, maintainable, and future-proof.

Consider this extension a **proof of concept** for modern TYPO3 development practices.

## Advantages

This approach offers several advantages over traditional Extbase extensions:

- **Automated SQL Generation**: SQL tables are dynamically created based on your Content Blocks configuration, eliminating the need for manual SQL scripting.
- **Automated TCA Generation**: The TCA is automatically generated, reducing the risk of errors and saving development time.
- **Simplified Property Management**: Adding or modifying properties requires changes to only **2 files** ([`config.yaml`](./ContentBlocks/RecordTypes/location/config.yaml) and [`Model.php`](./Classes/Domain/Model/Location.php)), streamlining development.
- **Reduced Boilerplate Code**: By using **public properties** in the model (with property hooks in PHP 8.4), the need for repetitive getter and setter methods is minimized.
- **Increased Robustness**: With less custom code, there are fewer opportunities for bugs, making the extension more stable and reliable.
- **Easier TYPO3 Upgrades**: Content Blocks handle much of the heavy lifting, ensuring smoother transitions during TYPO3 updates.

## Disadvantages

- **Dependency on External Library**: Currently, **"friendsoftypo3/content-blocks"** is not part of the TYPO3 core. However, this is expected to change with the release of **TYPO3 14**.
