# TYPO3 Extbase Extension based on Content Blocks
This extension uses ["friendsoftypo3/content-blocks"]([https://www.google.com](https://github.com/FriendsOfTYPO3/content-blocks)) to generate its TCA and SQL via ContentBlocks (RecordTypes). Altough this extension has 4 models, the only TCA in this extension is the registering of a plugin in tt_content.php. All the needed SQL is generated by content blocks.

View this extension as a proof of concept.

## Advantages
A few advantages of this extension, compared to a standard extbase extension:

- SQL is automatically generated
- TCA is automaticall generated
- It's easier to add new properties, as you only have to edit 2 Files (config.yaml and Model.php)
- Using public properties in the model (with property Hooks in PHP 8.4) further reduces boilerplate code
- More robust, as you the extension has less code that can break
- Easier maintainability for TYPO3 Updates as content blocks does the hard work for you

## Disadvantages
- At the moment "friendsoftypo3/content-blocks" is not part of the TYPO3 core, but this should change with TYPO3 14
